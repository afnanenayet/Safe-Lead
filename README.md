# Safe-Lead
A native OSX application that determines whether the lead in a basketball game is safe based on a classic algorithm that takes into account: time remaining, which team has possession, and points.

##Known Issues
Currently, there is a bug if a user does not fill in all of the text boxes that take integers with integers, and doesn't switch out of the text box after the submit button is enabled. The application will crash.
